General notes
-------------

"1. When creating a new map, start by adjusting the coordinate system to the relevant UTM zone."

"2. When revising the MXD files, check that these steps are taken first in order to avoid file size increases due to geoprocessing results being stored:"

"- Title: have set up as example, using Reliefweb titling convention. May sometimes need 4 lines for longer titles."
"- Description: in place of sub-title, now shown as an 'abstract' to help users understand what the map depicts. NOTE: some may say the description text should be column-justified, I tried this but it can look a bit ugly, so I reverted to left-justified."
"- Other marginalia:  have just done a minor tidy up, including:"
- 'Map Doc Num' now 'Map document'
